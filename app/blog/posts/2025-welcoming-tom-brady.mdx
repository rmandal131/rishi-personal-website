I’m thrilled to welcome NFL icon, Tom Brady, to Future! Tom will join our team and Board of Directors, as co-chairman.

Today, we’re excited to announce that Future is merging with Autograph, which was founded by Tom. Through 23 seasons in the NFL, Tom led his teams to an incredible 10 Super Bowl appearances, 7 Super Bowl victories, and 286 wins – all records. If nothing else, Tom is the paragon of longevity and success. And it’s no coincidence that throughout his career, he worked each day with coaches and trainers – experts who knew his strengths, weaknesses, preferences, schedule, and goals, enabling him to play at the highest level for decades.

With Tom’s leadership, we aim to bring the same level of care and coaching that the world’s greatest athletes rely on to many more people, from New Years beginners to Olympians on the world stage, and beyond. We aspire to combine the world’s best coaches with AI, software, and sensors to train billions of people globally.

We are equally excited at the prospect of collaborating with Autograph’s athlete advisors, including Simone Biles, Usain Bolt, Wayne Gretzky, Tony Hawk, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka, and others. Each of these greats embodies that rare combination of success and longevity.

We can’t wait to share the ways that we plan to make Future even better and more accessible. Stay tuned. If you’re interested in helping us achieve our vision, we’re hiring across every team— join us.

Onward!
